# Project Progress Tracker

A single-file HTML dashboard for tracking project delivery progress, with deep integration into [Rocketlane](https://www.rocketlane.com/), [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/), [Oneflow](https://oneflow.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/), and [Younium](https://younium.com/) — all routed through a single Tampermonkey bridge that re-uses each platform's existing browser session.

## 🌐 Try it live

**[hapnes-dev.github.io/Project-Progress-Tracker](https://hapnes-dev.github.io/Project-Progress-Tracker/)**

The hosted version always runs the latest commit on `main`. State is stored in *your* browser's `localStorage` — nothing leaves your device. You still need to install the Tampermonkey bridge below for cross-origin API calls to work.

Prefer a local copy? Download `Project Progress Tracker.html` and open it from your desktop — it works the same way.

## Features

### Project management
- **Project list with status pills**, team-group workload sections (Team kulde + Others), sorting & filtering, plant ID quick-link to PANG.
- **Owner lanes group by the REAL Rocketlane project owner** — the same name the detail panel's "Owner:" chip shows, not whoever imported the project. The owner is backfilled for **all** projects from the `/projects/lightV1` payload on every load (`projectGroupOwnerName`), so lanes match Rocketlane ownership automatically; your own lane sorts first.
- **✓ Complete all** button on each task-category header (shown only while the category has open tasks): confirms, then completes every open task through the same per-task path as a manual click — each completion syncs to Rocketlane, subtasks complete before parents.
- **Rocketlane status-sync queue with per-task badges**: task status changes sync to Rocketlane strictly **one at a time** (FIFO) instead of all at once. Each affected task shows a badge under its title — **⏳ Queued** → spinning **Syncing to Rocketlane…** → green **✓ Synced to Rocketlane** (clears itself after a few seconds), or red **⚠ Rocketlane sync failed** (the status reverts as before, and the rest of the queue keeps going). When a batch finishes, one toast summarises it (e.g. "all 5 status changes synced ✓") instead of a toast per task. Changing the same task again while its earlier change is still waiting skips the stale request and only the latest status is sent.
- **Per-project detail view**: notes, status, due dates, custom links (Oneflow / Younium / HubSpot), task categories with **one-level sub-tasks** (a subtask can't have its own subtask; created subtasks sync to Rocketlane in the parent's phase), expandable task notes & descriptions, in-progress / blocked / waiting-on-partner / need-assistance status.
- **Per-project toolbar shortcuts**: 🚀 Rocketlane, 📁 Files, 📦 Order info, ☄️ PANG (plant control), 👥 BAF (user database), Edit, Remove.
- **📁 Files popover** lets you **upload** to the project's **General Shared Files** — an **⬆ Upload** button (header) or **drag-and-drop** files anywhere on the popover (dashed outline on hover). Works even on a project with no files yet. Needs bridge **v1.9.16+** (it creates the attachment with `sourceType:FOLDER` then links it into the folder, mirroring Rocketlane's own 2-step flow). It also has a **⬇ Download all (N)** button — prompts you to choose a destination folder **each time** via the File System Access API (`showDirectoryPicker`, starting at the last-used folder for a quick one-click), then writes every project attachment into a per-project, **date-stamped** subfolder there (named `<project name> <YYYY-MM-DD>`). Filename collisions auto-resolve as `name (1).ext`, `name (2).ext`. Falls back to per-file `<a download>` on browsers without the API.

### Project status (8-state, bidirectional with Rocketlane)
- Local status enum matches **Rocketlane's project Status field 1:1**: `Proposed` · `In Planning` · `To be Staffed` · `In progress` · `On Hold` · `Blocked` · `Completed` · `Cancelled`.
- **Push** (instant): change the status pill or save the Edit dialog → `PUT /projects/<id>` with the numeric option value (e.g. 3 = `Completed`). No more manually re-clicking the status on Rocketlane's settings page.
- **Pull** (every sync, not just on first import): each Rocketlane sync now overwrites `local.status` from `remoteProject.fields[]["Status"].metaFieldValue.label`. Rocketlane stays the source of truth — change the status on either side and the other catches up.
- Existing tracker installs with old `open` / `in_progress` / `waiting_partner` / `finished` / `closed` statuses migrate transparently on next load via `normalizeStatus()`.

### Owner Workload Overview (collapsible)
- **Team groups**: Team kulde lists a fixed roster (configured at `OWNER_TEAM_GROUPS`); everyone else falls into Others.
- **Collapsible sections** (whole overview + each team) with per-localStorage state.
- **Live counts from Rocketlane**: total active projects + "In progress" specifically per teammate, fetched from `/projects/lightV1` (which returns `teamMembers` inline so we don't have to fan out to /members).
- **"owns N" chip**: alongside the "N project(s)" count (which includes projects they're just a team member on), each card shows how many of those they're the **project owner** of — hover it to see the owned project names.
- **Cross-user workload sharing**: each agent's Low / Normal / High / Need Work / On Hold selection is stored in a hidden `[Tracker] Workload Sync` Rocketlane meta-project (one task per user, plain-text token in `taskDescription`). Pull on every 5-min sync; push on every picker change.
- **Manual refresh button** next to the heading re-pulls every teammate's project counts + workload values from Rocketlane on demand (the icon spins while fetching) — handy right after someone's status changes, instead of waiting for the 5-min sync.

### Rocketlane integration
- **Sync (bidirectional)**: 5-min pull when tab is visible (resumes on focus), push-on-change within 2.5s, manual single-project sync via the "RL sync" chip.
- **Click any project → instant single-project sync** of just that one (no fan-out).
- **Tasks**: add / remove with upstream propagation (delete is gated by ⚠ confirm). **Task status** changes push to Rocketlane; if a task's Rocketlane counterpart was deleted or made access-restricted, the tracker keeps your local status and clears the dead link instead of reverting.
- **Chat history viewer** for project conversations: Private + General tabs, file attachments, inline image previews, lightbox, @-mention picker (diacritic-insensitive), notifications drawer with filter chips and rich previews. Image previews auto-refresh Rocketlane's expiring signed links (so they no longer go blank after the panel sits open — previously needed a page refresh).
- **Hubspot Deal Description writer**: when you save a project, the Rocketlane custom field "Hubspot Deal Description" is updated with a plain `Links:` block listing the project's Oneflow / Younium / HubSpot URLs. Field is discovered via the tenant `/fields` endpoint when it doesn't yet exist on the project.

### Task notes & private notes (synced to Rocketlane)

Expand any task to edit two independent notes that mirror Rocketlane's task drawer:

- **Description note** — the task's main description. For Rocketlane-linked tasks it reads/writes the Rocketlane task description; for local-only tasks it's stored in the tracker.
- **Private note** — hidden behind a **+ Add a private note** link (matching Rocketlane's own affordance); click it to reveal a cream editor. For linked tasks this syncs to Rocketlane's task-level **`privateTaskDescription`** field — the same private note shown in the task drawer — via `PUT /projects/<projectId>/tasks/<taskId>/mini`. **Clearing** the note in the tracker also clears it in Rocketlane, and notes authored **in** Rocketlane pull back into the tracker on every sync.

Stored locally as `t.privateNote`, kept separate from the description so the two never collide. Saved on Enter or click-away. Both note editors **resize by dragging anywhere along their bottom edge** — a full-width handle, not just the fiddly native corner grip.

A **Task notes overview** at the top of the project detail surfaces every task that needs attention — any task that isn't completed and either has a note or a non-"To do"/"In progress" status — as a card showing the category, **task name**, status, and note. Any URL in the note renders as a **clickable link** (opens in a new tab; clicking it doesn't also open the task). Subtasks are marked with a `↳` and their parent ("under &lt;parent&gt;"). Click a card to jump to that task in its category.

### Zendesk Tasks (per project)
- **Section** under "Chat history" in the project detail panel, sorted by **last public reply** (not generic `updated_at`). Matches tickets by **plant ID and store name** (merged), so tickets that name the store but not the plant number still show.
- Each row shows status pill + subject + "Last reply 25.05 14:17 (i dag)" (24-h Oslo timezone, Norwegian locale).
- **Inline preview** shows the newest comment + a "Right-click to open fullscreen — read full thread & reply" hint.
- **Right-click anywhere on a ticket card** → fullscreen overlay (portal-mounted to `<body>` to escape `contain: layout` clipping). Full conversation rendered from sanitized `html_body` (signatures, inline images, attachments), with a Public reply / Internal note toggle and Ctrl+Enter shortcut.
- **Auto session renewal** on 401 via the documented `X-Zendesk-Renew-Session: true` header — and the same auto-retry pattern is now in place for Oneflow, HubSpot, and Younium too.

### Notifications bell (Rocketlane + Zendesk)

The 🔔 in the project-list toolbar shows a combined **unread count** and opens a left-side drawer.

- **Unread badge** = unread Rocketlane notifications (chat, mentions, status changes) **plus** Zendesk tickets assigned to you with a new public reply. Hover the bell for a per-source breakdown. Refreshes every 2 min while the tab is visible, and on focus.
- **Clicking the bell resets the count and it stays cleared.** Rocketlane's server-side "mark seen" API currently rejects the call, so the tracker keeps its own per-source last-seen timestamps (`rocketlane_notif_last_seen_v1`, `zendesk_notif_last_seen_v1`) and counts unread against `max(serverLastSeen, localLastSeen)` — the count clears reliably on click, and genuinely-new items re-raise it.
- **Zendesk "recent replies" list** at the top of the drawer (collapsible): your assigned tickets that have an **incoming reply** (from someone other than you) — **public replies and internal/private notes** (so partner emails that land as private comments aren't missed). A private note is tagged **"Internal"** only when it's from a **@kiona.com** colleague; private comments from external parties show as a normal reply. A case **stays listed even after you reply** — it's a worklist of conversations to keep an eye on, not just unanswered ones. Defaults to the **last month**, newest on top, with **filter chips** — *All / Awaiting / Replied* (by whether you've answered) and a *Hide solved/closed* toggle (on by default) — plus a **"Show more"** button that loads one more month per click (up to 6). Replies arriving since your last click are flagged **New**; the list **persists across opens** (opening only resets the count, it never empties the list). Cases you've answered also show a **"↩ You replied"** line with your own reply. Left-click a row to open the ticket in Zendesk; **right-click to read the full reply (and yours) — and reply right there in a centered fullscreen popup** (a **Public reply / Internal note** toggle + textarea, **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** to send, exactly like the Zendesk Tasks fullscreen). Sending posts to Zendesk and refreshes both the conversation and the row's "↩ You replied" line; closed tickets show a "can't reply" notice instead.
- **Rocketlane notifications** below, under their own **collapsible "Rocketlane · notifications" header** (caret + group count, same style as the Zendesk section; state saved in `rocketlane_notif_collapsed_v1`, default expanded). The **source filter chips** — *All / Tasks I'm assigned to / Mentions / Assigned to the team* — live **inside** this section (styled like the Zendesk filters), so they collapse with it. Each notification shows actor, action, chat-message preview, and a relative time ("8m ago"). Left-click opens it in Rocketlane; **right-click reads the full message fullscreen** (Esc / × / backdrop closes).
- **Incremental fetch cache — only changed/new data loads.** Each Zendesk ticket's latest incoming reply is cached keyed by the ticket's `updated_at` (`zendesk_ticket_cache_v5`, capped, localStorage). A repeat fetch still runs the one cheap search to learn what changed, but only tickets whose `updated_at` actually changed re-hit the comments API — verified live: 14 comment calls on a cold fetch, **0** on the next when nothing changed. Each author is cached by id as `{ name, kiona }` (`zendesk_author_cache_v2`) — the `kiona` flag (author email ends `@kiona.com`) drives the internal-note tagging above; Rocketlane group fetches are de-duped for ~10s so the badge poll and a drawer-open don't double-fetch.

### Auto-find buttons (🔎)
The Edit project dialog has a **🔎 Find** button next to the Oneflow / HubSpot / Younium link fields. Each one extracts the plant ID prefix from the project name and searches the corresponding system:

| Field | Endpoint | Match strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Oneflow | `GET /api/agreements/?q=<plantId>` | Plant-ID prefix +50, name token overlap +0..30, partner in parties +20. Threshold ≥60 + clear-lead. |
| HubSpot | `POST /api/crm-search/search` (objectTypeId `0-3`) | Plant ID anywhere in `dealname` +50, token overlap +0..30, partner in name +20. Same threshold logic. |
| Younium | `POST /api/data/query/order` | Native `plant_id` field — exact string match. 1 match → auto-fill; 2+ → picker (newest first). |

High-confidence matches fill the URL automatically; multiple candidates show an inline picker.

### Younium status chip (per project)

A status chip in the project header meta row (between the **Updated** and **RL sync** chips) showing the verdict for the project's Younium order + subscription state. Styled identically to the sibling chips — pill shape, 11.5px font, color tint per verdict (green / yellow / red / gray).

| Color / label | When |
|---|---|
| 🟢 `Younium: ✓ All good` | Order Invoiced AND IWMAC subscription Active |
| 🟢 `Younium: ✓ Invoiced (one-time)` | Order Invoiced, no IWMAC subscription product |
| ⏳ `Younium: ⏳ Awaiting first invoice` | Order present, no posted invoices yet |
| ⏳ `Younium: ⏳ Subscription starts <date>` | Subscription start date is in the future |
| ⚠ `Younium: ⚠ Activate order in Younium` | Order is Draft — needs activation |
| ⚠ `Younium: ⚠ Activate subscription in Younium` | IWMAC subscription is Draft — needs activation |
| ⚠ `Younium: ⚠ Status uncertain` | Data incomplete |
| ✗ `Younium: ✗ Cancelled` / `✗ Expired` | Terminal — can't recover |
| ⏳ `Younium: ⏳ Checking…` | Verdict is being fetched |

**Clicking the chip** opens a fullscreen modal with:
- **Status summary** — action-oriented one-liner (e.g. "Action needed: Subscription is in Draft state. Activate it in Younium to start invoicing.")
- **Warnings panel** — only when problems exist
- **Order / offer** section — Younium link, IDs, name, status (color-coded ✓), invoice status, dates, Created by / Last updated by
- **Subscription** section — found via plant_id lookup, shows IWMAC product status + dates + Created by / Last updated by
- **Other orders for this plant** section — compact rows for sibling orders (Younium versions orders, so a single plant can have multiple records). Each row's status badge shows the **real order status** — Invoiced / Not invoiced / Draft / Cancelled / Created / Pending start — not just the raw Active/Draft lifecycle state: an active row briefly reads "Active", then (while the modal is open) its invoices are fetched and the badge upgrades to Invoiced or Not invoiced, matching the primary order's verdict

**Subscription detection**: a Younium order is treated as an IWMAC subscription when (a) any product on the order has a name matching the strict pattern `/\bIWMAC\s*(?:Abonnement|Subscription)\b/i` — i.e. literally `IWMAC Subscription` or `IWMAC Abonnement`, NOT `IWMAC Modul / Product` (those are Order/Offer line items, not subscription evidence) — OR (b) we find such an order via the `plant_id` custom field. **All three entry paths now run the plant_id fallback**: when the saved URL points to an Order, a Quote, OR is empty entirely. For projects with no saved Younium link, the plant's most-recently-modified `isLastVersion=true` order is automatically promoted into the Order/Offer section so the modal is never blank.

**Audit attribution** (bridge v1.9.11+): `Created by` and `Last updated by` rows come from the Younium event log endpoint (`GET /api/eventlog/order/id/{id}`). First/latest events sorted by timestamp.

**Activated orders read "Active", not "Created (not finalized)"**: Younium keeps `status: 1` on an order after draft activation — only the real `O-######` number and the UI badge change. Status 1 counts as "not finalized" only while the order number still looks like a draft; an activated, started, not-yet-invoiced order shows **✓ Active** (green) with the invoice row carrying the actionable state. Payment/delivery header statuses surface too: **Partially paid / Paid / Partially delivered / Delivered** (partials render yellow with an em-dash).

**Order/Offer slot prefers the real order**: when no Younium link is saved and the plant's orders are discovered by `plant_id`, the newest **non-subscription** document becomes the Order/Offer section; the "… Abonnementsavtale" goes in the Subscription section (it previously hijacked both).

**Outdated version auto-heal**: activation creates a NEW order version with a new id, so a saved link can go stale. Both the order and subscription links follow the version chain (`youniumResolveCurrentVersion`: plant + description + account match) to the current version, and the tracker **auto-rewrites the saved link** to it — reported in the Warnings panel ("auto-updated it to the activated version"). It only rewrites a slot that already had a link, and never touches Younium itself.

**Never writes to Younium**: the modal reads only — no invoicing, no activation. The only thing it edits is the project's own saved link (the auto-heal above).

### Oneflow status chip (per project)

A sibling chip next to the Younium one answering a single question: **is the project's Oneflow document signed?** Same UI pattern (colored chip → fullscreen modal, reusing the Younium modal's styling), driven by the agreement lifecycle `state`: **4 Signed → green ✓**, 1 Pending / 2 Overdue → yellow ⏳, 0 Draft / 3 Declined / 5 Cancelled → red ✗.

The modal shows a **Document / order** section (from `oneflowUrl`) and a **Subscription agreement** section (from `oneflowSubscriptionUrl`) — each with Signed?, sent/signed/expiry dates, and the **Parties** with a per-participant ✓ (on a fully-signed agreement every participant shows ✓, since a non-signing viewer keeps `state 0` even when the document is complete). Footer: Refresh, Copy summary, Open document/subscription. Background-checks once per project per session; verdict cached on `project.oneflowStatus`. Read-only against Oneflow.

### Per-platform bridges (Tampermonkey userscript v1.9.11+)

All four cookie/JWT bridges share the same auto-retry contract: on 401, the bridge fires one credential-refresh call (Zendesk's renew-session header, Oneflow's `/positions/me` warmup, HubSpot's `/login-verify/v1/info` warmup, or Younium's Frontegg token mint) and retries the original request exactly once before giving up. You shouldn't see "session expired" errors as long as you have the relevant tab open or — for Younium — a valid Frontegg refresh cookie.



| Platform | Auth model | Capture |
|---|---|---|
| Rocketlane | api-key in `localStorage.__api_key` | UUID + userId from the parsed array, stored in `GM_setValue("rlApiKey")`. |
| Zendesk | HttpOnly session cookie + CSRF in meta tag | `<meta name="csrf-token">` value re-captured every 60s when an `iwmac.zendesk.com` tab is open. |
| Oneflow | HttpOnly session cookie + `xsrf-token` cookie (Spring-style double-submit) | Cookie value via `document.cookie`, refreshed every 60s. |
| HubSpot | HttpOnly session cookie + `hubspotapi-csrf` cookie + portal ID | Portal ID extracted from URL path, CSRF from cookie, hublet host (US vs EU) from `location.origin`. |
| Younium | Frontegg HttpOnly refresh cookie → JWT bearer | Bridge calls `/frontegg/.../token/refresh` on demand and caches the 24h-lived access token. Region (eu/us) captured from page hostname. |

All bridges route through `GM_xmlhttpRequest`, which is exempt from CORS — no tokens are stored in the tracker HTML.

## Architecture overview

| Component | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| App UI + API clients | `Project Progress Tracker.html` (single file, no build) |
| Cross-origin bridge | `rocketlane-chat-bridge/rocketlane-chat-bridge.user.js` (Tampermonkey userscript v1.9.11+) |
| State storage | Browser `localStorage` (per-browser, never leaves the device) |
| Per-platform secrets | Tampermonkey GM storage (never embedded in HTML) |

The bridge is required for **any** cross-origin API call from `github.io` or `file://`. The tracker on `github.io` has a CORS-allowed direct-fetch path to Rocketlane's tenant API as an optimisation, but for Zendesk / Oneflow / HubSpot / Younium the bridge is the only option (their CORS policies only allow same-origin).

## Install

### 1. Download the tracker HTML (or use the live URL)

- **Live URL** (auto-updates): https://hapnes-dev.github.io/Project-Progress-Tracker/
- **Local file**: download `Project Progress Tracker.html` from this repo and open it from your Desktop.

### 2. Install Tampermonkey (Chrome extension)

[Tampermonkey Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

### 3. Install the Rocketlane Chat Bridge userscript (covers all five integrations)

**One-click install (recommended — auto-updates):**

👉 [**Install Rocketlane Chat Bridge**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hapnes-dev/tampermonkey-scripts/main/rocketlane-chat-bridge/rocketlane-chat-bridge.user.js)

Despite the name, this single userscript also bridges Zendesk, Oneflow, HubSpot, and Younium. Tampermonkey will open an install prompt — confirm **Install**. The script auto-updates on every push.

> **Auto-update prompt (always checks for the newest):** on every load the tracker fetches the latest bridge `@version` from GitHub and, if your installed copy is behind, pops a dismissible **"Tampermonkey bridge outdated → Update bridge"** card (bottom-right). The check is version-agnostic, so it nudges you to **every** new bridge release automatically (new features + fixes — e.g. the desktop notifications). One click opens Tampermonkey's update prompt. Requires bridge **v1.9.15+** (older bridges can't report their version, so they're flagged until updated).

The userscript is hosted in a separate repo: [Hapnes-dev/tampermonkey-scripts → rocketlane-chat-bridge](https://github.com/Hapnes-dev/tampermonkey-scripts/tree/main/rocketlane-chat-bridge).

### 4. Enable file URL access (only for local file mode)

`chrome://extensions` → Tampermonkey → Details → **Allow access to file URLs**.

Skip this if you only use the live GitHub Pages URL.

### 5. Visit each platform once while logged in

Each bridge captures auth state from the user's existing session — you don't paste any keys. Just visit these once after installing the userscript:

| Visit | Why |
|---|---|
| `https://kiona.rocketlane.com` | Capture api-key from `localStorage.__api_key`. |
| `https://iwmac.zendesk.com` | Capture CSRF token from `<meta name="csrf-token">`. |
| `https://app.oneflow.com` | Capture `xsrf-token` cookie value. |
| `https://app-eu1.hubspot.com` (or `app.hubspot.com` for US) | Capture portal ID + CSRF cookie + hublet host. |
| `https://eu.younium.com` (or `us.younium.com`) | Record region; bridge mints JWTs from there. |

Refresh the tracker — all five integrations should now work.

The Rocketlane key auto-renews; Zendesk & Oneflow re-capture their CSRF every 60s while their tabs are open; HubSpot does the same for CSRF + portal; Younium mints fresh JWTs on demand and caches them for 24h.

## Day-to-day usage

- **Refresh** projects: click **Sync** in the toolbar (or wait — auto-sync runs every 5 min).
- **Refresh one project**: click anywhere on the project card → instant background sync.
- **Find a project**: press **Ctrl/Cmd+F** to jump to the search box (filters by name, partner, owner, notes). It won't hijack the browser's find while you're typing in a note/chat/dialog or a fullscreen reader is open.
- **Add Rocketlane projects**: **+ RL Project** in the toolbar — paste a URL, or browse a team member's projects and **Import selected**. The picker lists projects where the person is the owner **or** a team member; tick **"Only show projects owned by &lt;name&gt;"** to hide the ones where they're just a member.
- **View chat**: select a project → "Chat history" → Private or General tab.
- **Send a chat message**: type in the compose box; Enter sends, Shift+Enter for newline. Paste an image with Ctrl+V or click 📎. Type `@` to mention.
- **Expand chat fullscreen**: click ⤢ in the chat header or right-click the chat area.
- **Project files**: 📁 Files in the toolbar.
- **Notifications**: 🔔 in the toolbar — a combined Rocketlane + Zendesk unread count. Click to open the drawer (resets the count but keeps the list); right-click any comment/reply to read it fullscreen. For a **Zendesk** reply, the fullscreen view also has a **Public reply / Internal note** composer (Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to send) so you can answer without leaving the tracker. The drawer header has a **🔔 Alerts** toggle — turn it on (it asks for browser-notification permission once) to get a **desktop popup** whenever a new Rocketlane/Zendesk notification arrives while the tracker tab is open. Each new item pops once; an existing backlog never blasts.
- **Add a task**: scroll to a category → **+ Add task** → a dialog asks for the task name + **Public/Private** visibility. Created locally AND in Rocketlane in the same phase, with the chosen visibility.
- **Add / rename / remove a category**: **+ Add category** opens a dialog (name, **start/due dates** (default today, editable), **Shared/Private** type, optional **description** — like Rocketlane's Create-project-phase) and creates a matching Rocketlane **phase** — and when you pick a module preset, its generic **Design + Integration** tasks are created in Rocketlane too (not just locally). A **"🧾 From order info / HubSpot line items"** preset reads the project's order info and auto-creates a category for each IWMAC module the order contains (Refrigeration, Ventilation, Energy, Wireless, Heating/VGV, Machine Room, **Smart Function** — that last one gets **no generic tasks**, just the order's own deliverables) — each with the generic **Design + Integration** tasks **plus a task per order line item** (and the line item's indented sub-bullets — whether **dash-prefixed** or a **nested list** — **as subtasks**). **The phase, every task, and every subtask (nested under its parent) are all created in Rocketlane** — they appear in the tracker instantly and finish syncing upstream in the background (a toast reports how many tasks were created). Only **one import runs at a time** — clicking the button again while a run is still fetching/syncing shows "already running" instead of starting an overlapping run that would double-create tasks. If a category already exists, it **backfills only the missing tasks/subtasks** (matched by normalized text) instead of skipping — so re-running after you've deleted a task (or an earlier half-create left an empty category) tops it back up rather than reporting "already exists". It also pushes up any tasks that exist in the tracker but aren't in Rocketlane yet, and won't duplicate ones already there. Line items that describe a **different discipline** than the module they're listed under — e.g. **"System image - Machinery"** (with its Maskintegning / VGV-bilde sub-bullets), which appears under Refrigeration — are pulled out and **merged into the Machine Room category** (created with its generic tasks if the order didn't otherwise contain a Machine Room module). **Individual sub-bullets** can be promoted too: **"Nytt oversiktsbilde"** (the store overview image) under "IWMAC Image" / `IWMAC Product: Images` is pulled out of its parent item and becomes its **own task under Refrigeration and freezing systems**, while its Maskinbilde/VGV siblings stay subtasks in Machine Room. A **whole module header** can be promoted the same way when it isn't a discipline of its own: every line item under **`IWMAC Modul: Add-on`** — e.g. *"IWMAC Setup: Direct integration, waterpump"* — is merged into **Machine Room** rather than dropped along with the unmapped header, while an item's own discipline rule still wins (an *Integration Gateway* listed under Add-on still lands in Refrigeration). **`IWMAC Modul: Basic`** and **`IWMAC Product: Drivers`** stay dropped on purpose. If the order info is instead a **flat HubSpot line-items list** (no `IWMAC Modul:` headers — e.g. pasted straight from a HubSpot deal), each line item is classified into a discipline by keyword (Refrigeration / Ventilation / Energy / Machine Room / Heating / Wireless) and the matching categories are created the same way; items that aren't a discipline (a HW gateway, a Modbus driver) are skipped. **`IWMAC License` line items are always skipped** (in both the flat and the `IWMAC Modul:` formats) — the license is implied by the discipline category, not a deliverable task. **Right-click a category header** → *Rename / Remove* — renaming also renames the phase; removing (after a **double confirm**) deletes the phase and its tasks. Applies only to Rocketlane-linked projects (otherwise local-only).
- **Rename / remove a task**: **right-click the task name** → *Rename task / Open fullscreen / Remove task* (the **Remove** button next to the task still works too). If the task is linked to Rocketlane, removal ⚠ confirms the upstream delete.

### Zendesk Tasks (per project)
- Section appears in projects whose name starts with a numeric plant ID.
- **Click a ticket** → inline preview of the latest comment.
- **Right-click anywhere on the ticket card** → fullscreen with full thread + reply compose.
- Public reply / Internal note toggle; **Ctrl+Enter** sends.

### Owner Workload Overview
- Click any teammate's pill to set their workload (syncs to other tracker users via the meta-project).
- Click a section header chevron to collapse / expand.

### Edit project dialog — auto-find external links
- **🔎 Find** next to each link field searches the corresponding system and auto-fills the URL (or shows a picker if multiple candidates). Matching scores each candidate on the project's plant ID, name, partner, contact, money and the HubSpot deal's custom fields — including any links already curated in the deal description, each routed to its correct field (Order/offer vs Subscription).
- On **Save**, the project's Rocketlane "Hubspot Deal Description" field is updated with a `Links:` block listing the populated Oneflow / Younium / HubSpot URLs.

## Data & privacy

- All app state stays in your browser's `localStorage` (key: `progress_tracker_state_v1`).
- **No api keys or secrets are embedded in the HTML.** Tokens / cookies / CSRF values live only in Tampermonkey's GM storage and the browser's cookie jar.
- No telemetry, no analytics, no external services besides the integrated platforms themselves.
- The "Local-only" rule:
  - **Project remove** never deletes from Rocketlane — only hides locally.
  - **Owner renames** never sync upstream.
  - **Task removal** DOES sync upstream when the task is linked — with a loud ⚠ confirm first.
  - **Category add / rename / removal** DOES sync — creates / renames / deletes the matching Rocketlane phase. A preset or "From order info" category also creates its **tasks + subtasks** upstream (not just the phase); deletion cascades the phase's tasks + double-confirms first.
  - All other edits (status, due date, links, notes, task add) DO push to Rocketlane.

## Security model

- **Bridge `@match` allowlist**: `kiona.rocketlane.com`, `iwmac.zendesk.com`, `app.oneflow.com`, `app.hubspot.com`, `app-eu1.hubspot.com`, `eu.younium.com`, `us.younium.com`, `app.younium.com`, `file:///*`, `https://hapnes-dev.github.io/Project-Progress-Tracker/*`.
- The broad `file:///*` match is **gated by a meta tag** — the bridge only publishes its API to `file://` pages that include `<meta name="rocketlane-tracker" content="hapnes-dev/Project-Progress-Tracker">`. Any other local HTML you open gets nothing.
- Tokens / cookies are never logged in plaintext; diagnostic logs only report presence + length.
- Untrusted HTML (Rocketlane chat, Zendesk comments, mention markup, notification previews) is sanitised through strict allowlists before insertion into the DOM.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `RocketlaneBridge` undefined | Install Tampermonkey + userscript; for local file: enable "Allow access to file URLs" in Tampermonkey's extension settings. |
| Bridge installed but data empty | Visit each platform's page once while logged in (see Install step 5). |
| 401 errors in console | Bridge tries to auto-renew on the very next attempt. If you still see 401, the underlying session is dead — log back into the relevant platform tab and retry. |
| Younium calls fail with "session expired" | Visit `eu.younium.com` once; the Frontegg refresh cookie is needed for JWT minting. |
| HubSpot Find returns "CSRF token not captured" | Visit any `app-eu1.hubspot.com` page once. |
| Zendesk Tasks shows "bridge unavailable" | Update bridge to v1.9.0+ and visit `iwmac.zendesk.com` once. |
| Save doesn't fill "Hubspot Deal Description" | Update tracker to commit `2c08956`+ (tenant-fields fallback for projects where the field hasn't been written yet). |
| Add task creates phaseless task | Update bridge to v1.8.1+ AND hard-refresh — older code sent `phase: {...}` instead of `projectPhase: {...}`. |

For deeper diagnostics in DevTools:
- `window.__rlSyncStats.ticks` — recent auto-sync outcomes
- `window.__zd.csrf()` — Zendesk CSRF capture status
- `window.__of.csrf()` — Oneflow CSRF capture status
- `window.__hs.csrf()` — HubSpot CSRF + portal capture status
- `window.__yn.token()` — Younium JWT cache status
